# Data Analysis Project Using Python

We took the dataset "Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Success" from Kaggle to perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Modeling and Prediction using Logistic Regression to study the effect of various factors influencing Student Grades.

The project file is named as "notebook.ipynb"

I had also performed some additional analysis and I have included it in the file InternetGrade.ipynb
